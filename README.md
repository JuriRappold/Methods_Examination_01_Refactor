# Methods_Examination_01_Refactor
**Course:** Methods for Sustainable Programming <br>
**Project:**
## 5.) Refactor already existing project(s) to use Functional Programming
1. Research and present at least three concepts from Functional Programming
2. Evaluate which of your previously created project(s) in Python/Java that can be refactored to use the concepts
3. Motivate for each refactored project why it was chosen and what concept was used
4. Reflect on the changes made to the projects, focus on readability and code complexity
## 4.) Compare Functional Programming to another programming paradigm
1. Give a theoretical overview of the two chosen paradigms
2. Highlight differences and similarities between the two paradigms
3. Implement example(s) to illustrate the differences in how the same problem would be solved using the two paradigms
4. Point out what concepts from Functional Programming was used in the code example and explain them

## Steps
